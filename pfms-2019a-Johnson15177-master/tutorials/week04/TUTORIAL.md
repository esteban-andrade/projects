Week 4 Tutorial Questions
=========================
Work through these questions and make sure you understand what is going on in each example. 
If you have any questions about the material please raise them in the next tutorial session.

Polymorphism - Ex01
------------------

Building upon your solution in week 03 and the pure virtual function you ahve declared

Create a Square and Traingle and access them via a pointer to Shape.

* What happened when we try to access the area / perimeter functions
* How could we solve this problem?

Hints: Virtual

Polymorphism - Ex02
------------------

Building upon your previous solution.

* Create an array of 4 Shapes and use it to store 2 Triangles and 2 Rectangles
* Write a program that computes the total area of shapes in the array
* Write a program that accepets an x,y location and computes an area of all shapes that intersect that point


Library - Ex03
-----------------

Building upon your previous solution.

* Modify your code to create a shapes library

Now with your library

* Create an array of 4 Shapes and use it to store 2 Triangles and 2 Rectangles
* Write a program that accepets an x,y location and computes an area of all shapes that intersect that point
