Week 1 Tutorial Questions
=========================
We will cover the below material in the tutorial session.

Functions
---------
* Create a function that accepts a double value as a parameter and
* Returns a square value
* Returns a bool value if the double is greater than zero and the square value instead of initial passed value
* Returns bool value if the double is greater than zero, the square value, the cube value and the passed value incremented by one
* Loop over item 3 for 1-20
* How best protect the passed value?

Struct
------
* Create a structure called `Sensor` than contains
* A variable for the number of samples `num_samples`
* An array of samples `double[] samples`
* Pass structure to function and:
    * Populate the structure with a number of samples and random value samples
    * Create a function that increments the number of samples by one and stores samples as the natural logarithm of the index number
    * When will the last task fail?
    
Vector
------
* Create a vector if integers called  `data` 
* Create a loop to populate elements of `data` (each element [i] =i))
* Loop to print elements of vector
* How to create a vector of floats?

Vector of Vectors (Container of Data)
------
* Create a vector of vectors containing integers called  `data` 
* Create a loop to populate elements of `data` such that is is a matrix of 4x4 elements (each element row =i))
* Loop to print elements of `data`
* What else could you store in this container?
