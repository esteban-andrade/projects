Week 1 Pre-work
=========================

Work through these questions and make sure you understand what is going on in each example. 
If you have any questions about the material please raise them in the next interactive leacture / tutorial session.

Compiling Sample Provided 
--------------------------
* Compile [hello.cpp](./starter/hello.cpp)
    * via command line
    * QTCreator 

Compiling Sample from Lynda 
--------------------------
* Download the examples from [Lynda.com](https://online.uts.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_3161730_1&course_id=_38119_1&mode=reset)
* Create a CMakeLists.txt to enable compiling of working.cpp from Chap1
    * via command line
    * QTCreator 

Pointers & Reference
--------------------
* Assign a double x of value 41012
* Use a pointer ip to point to x
* Print the value of what ip is pointing to
* Make y reference to x
* Print the value of what y is referencing to
* Create a double z of value 1
* Use pointer ip to point to z
* Make y to reference to z
* Print the value of what ip and y is referencing to

C Arrays
--------
* Create an array x of doubles with 10 elements
* Initialise the elements of the array on creation, each element [i] has value i
* Create a loop to populate elements of x (each x[i] =i), how to code end of loop?)
* Can you use a pointer and loop to initialise elements of array

Loops - Typecasting
-------------------
* Create an string array `char[] x` to value `41012`
* Can we typecast to integer each value Add up all the elements (as numbers)?
* Can we count number of elements less than 2
* Use a for loop
* BONUS: Use a while loop / range-based for loop
