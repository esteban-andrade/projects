STL Vector
--------------------

Modify the file [sum_doubles.cpp](./starter/vector_iterator/sum_doubles.cpp) such that it

* Creates a vector of doubles with 4 values
* Adds a value to the end/back
* Modifies the 3rd value
* Prints out the numbers using a Range-based for loop with the auto keyword 
* Computes the sum via sum function using an iterator
* Prints sum to console
