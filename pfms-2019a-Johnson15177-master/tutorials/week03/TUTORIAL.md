Week 3 Tutorial Questions
=========================
Work through these questions to understand what is going on in each example. If you have any questions about the material please raise them in the next tutorial session.

Inheritance - Ex01
--------------------

This question is consolidated from Quiz1, use your implementation of [quiz1](../../quizzes/quiz1/b) as the starter.

Refer to base class [Shape](../../quizzes/quiz1/b/shape.h) implement:

* Triangle as a class/subclass of Shape with getArea for an isosceles Triangles 
* Implement the area method in triangle

Consider: Which members (data/methods) should belong to base class

Inheritance - Ex02
---------------------

Building upon your previous solution.

* Implement a move centre method
* Implement an offset centre method

Consider: Where should this function be placed (both the declaration and implementation)?


Inheritance - Ex02
------------------

Building upon your previous solution.

* Create a Square and Traingle, can we store both of them in one vector?
* Write a program that accepets a point *(x,y location)* and displays all shapes that intersect that point (the point is within the area of the shape)?

Consider: What will be the type for this vector? Are there any issues with completing item 2?
