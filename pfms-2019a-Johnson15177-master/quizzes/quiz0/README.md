Part A
------
1) Attempt to compile the code in [folder a](./a). Why does the code fail to compile?
    - The code fails to compile due to there being two functions of the same name (void printArray())
    
2) Fix the compilation error. Why does a segmentation fault (segfault) occur?
    - A segmentation fault occurs when you attempt to access memory that does not belong to you, such as writing to a read only memory.
    - In this example the segmentation fault occurs when the number inputed is 3 and above.

3) Modify the code so it will run
    runs but still get segmentation fault, dont know how to fix

4) Create a function that prints only the elements of the array that are larger than : mean + one standard deviation


5) Create a function that assigns elements of array x to a vector named *vec* (HINT: decide on the correct type)
    

Part B
------
1) Look at the code in [folder b](./b). Implement the methods of the rectangle class in the [rectangle.cpp](./b/rectangle.cpp) file based on the definition provided in [rectangle.h](./b/rectangle.h)

2) Create an executable that uses the class to compute the area and perimeter of three rectangles

3) What do we call functions of a class?

4) What access specifiers are used?

5) What do we call variable *width_* in the *Rectangle* class?
